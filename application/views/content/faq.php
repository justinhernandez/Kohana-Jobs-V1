<h3>How long will they run?</h3>

	We will e-mail you the link to do so.
</p>

<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
<p>
	It's free, gratis and for nothing.

<h3>I'm new to Kohana and need somebody to help me out. Can I post a job?</h3>
<p>
	You could. However, note that this is not the place to look for free advice.
	Just keep that in mind with respect to the freelancers visiting this site.
	Alternatively, try the <a href="http://forum.kohanaphp.com/">Kohana forums</a>.

<h2 id="geert">About <span>the</span> guy who built this thing</h2>

<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>
	My name is Geert De Deckere.
	I am one of the developers of the Kohana PHP framework.
	You can read some of my webdev related articles at <a href="http://www.geertdedeckere.be/">my blog</a>.
	Also, I have my own small <a href="http://www.idoe.be/">rocket-powered webdesign lab</a> in Belgium.
	It is the place where all kind of secret regular expression experiments happen.
	Please don't tell anybody, okay?
</p>

<h3>Of course you coded this site?</h3>
<p>
	Yeah. However, I really want to thank all other Kohana developers for creating this great framework, upon which this site is built.
	You rock, guys!
</p>

<h3>Did you also design the site?</h3>
<p>
	Yes. Kudos to <a href="http://squidfingers.com/patterns/21/">Squidfingers</a> for the background pattern.
	All the rest is my personal work, including the briefcase icon in the header, which was a fun little Illustrator project on its own.
</p>

<p>
	Contact me at <?php echo html::mailto(Kohana::config('email.geert')) ?>.
